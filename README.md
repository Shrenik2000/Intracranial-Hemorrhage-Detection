# Intracranial-Hemorrhage-Detection
Hemorrhage in the brain (Intracranial Hemorrhage) is one of the top five fatal health problems. The hemorrhage
causes bleeding inside the skull (typically known as cranium). It accounts for approximately 10% of strokes in
the U.S thus diagnosing it quickly and efficiently is of utmost importance. Intracranial Hemorrhage can have
many consequences depending on the location, size, type of bleed in the brain. The relationship is not that
simple to interpret. A small hemorrhage might be equally fatal as a big one if it is in a critical location. If a
patient shows acute hemorrhage symptoms such as loss of consciousness, then an immediate diagnosis is
required to carry out the initial tests, but the procedure is very complicated and often time-consuming. The delay
in diagnosis and treatment can have severe effects on patients, especially the ones in need of immediate
attention. The solution proposed in this project aims to make this process efficient by automating the
preliminary step to identify the location, type, and size of the bleed, the doctors can provide a better diagnosis
and a faster one as the work of identification is done by the algorithm. Also, the algorithm treats every scan with
the same scrutiny, reducing human error and learning more as it goes. Thus, the challenge is to build an
algorithm to detect acute intracranial hemorrhage and its subtypes. This project will be a step towards
identifying each of these relevant attributes for a better diagnosis. In our project, we aim to automate the process
of detecting these bleeds in order to relieve overworked radiologists and flag patients in need of immediate
attention.
